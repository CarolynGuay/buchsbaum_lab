 abstract = {Understanding speech in noisy environments is challenging, especially for seniors. Although$\backslash$r$\backslash$nevidence suggests that older adults increasingly recruit prefrontal cortices to offset reduced$\backslash$r$\backslash$nperiphery and central auditory processing, the brain mechanisms underlying such$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncompensation remain elusive. Here we show that relative to young adults, older adults show$\backslash$r$\backslash$nhigher activation of frontal speech motor areas as measured by functional MRI during a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsyllable identification task at varying signal-to-noise ratios. This increased activity correlates$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwith improved speech discrimination performance in older adults. Multivoxel pattern$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclassification reveals that despite an overall phoneme dedifferentiation, older adults show$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngreater specificity of phoneme representations in frontal articulatory regions than auditory$\backslash$r$\backslash$nregions. Moreover, older adults with stronger frontal activity have higher phoneme specificity$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin frontal and auditory regions. Thus, preserved phoneme specificity and upregulation of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nactivity in speech motor regions provide a means of compensation in older adults for$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndecoding impoverished speech representations in adverse listening conditions.},
