The Buchsbaum laboratory studies how memories are stored, represented, and reactivated in the brain. We use functional neuroimaging, behavioural, and eye-tracking methods to investigate conscious memories. We are especially interested in how the quality and fidelity of complex memories--whether lagnuage-based, visual, or multimodal——can be captured, quantified, and modeled using data acquired from neuroimaging and eye-tracking measures.

Our lab is in the Rotman Research Institute, (https://www.baycrest.org/Baycrest/Research-Innovation/About-Us/Rotman-Research-Institute) which is located at Baycrest Hospital in Toronto, Canada.
