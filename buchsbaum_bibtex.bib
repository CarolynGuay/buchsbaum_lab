abstract = {The phonological loop system of Baddeley and colleagues' Working Memory model is a major accomplishment of the modern era of cognitive psychology. It was one of the first information processing models to make an explicit attempt to accommodate both traditional behavioral data and the results of neuropsychological case studies in an integrated theoretical framework. In the early and middle 1990s, the purview of the phonological loop was expanded to include the emerging field of functional brain imaging. The modular and componential structure of the phonological loop seemed to disclose a structure that might well be transcribed, intact, onto the convolutions of the brain. It was the phonological store component, however, with its simple and modular quality, that most appealed to the neuroimaging field as the psychological "box" that might most plausibly be located in the brain. Functional neuroimaging studies initially designated regions in the parietal cortex as constituting the "neural correlate" of the phonological store, whereas later studies pointed to regions in the posterior temporal cortex. In this review, however, we argue the phonological store as a theoretical construct does not precisely correspond to a single, functionally discrete, brain region. Rather, converging evidence from neurology, cognitive psychology, and functional neuroimaging argue for a reconceptualization of phonological short-term memory as emerging from the integrated action of the neural processes that underlie the perception and production of speech.},

abstract = {Models of both speech perception and speech production typically postulate a processing level that involves some form of phonological processing. There is disagreement, however, on the question of whether there are separate phonological systems for speech input versus speech output. We review a range of neuroscientific data that indicate that input and output phonological systems partially overlap. An important anatomical site of overlap appears to be the left posterior superior temporal gyrus. We then present the results of a new event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which participants were asked to listen to and then (covertly) produce speech. In each participant, we found two regions in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus that responded both to the perception and production components of the task, suggesting that there is overlap in the neural systems that participate in phonological aspects of speech perception and speech production. The implications for neural models of verbal working memory are also discussed in connection with our findings. {\textcopyright} 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

Drawing on experimental designs used in recent work in sensory–motor integration in the cortical visual system, we used fMRI in an effort to identify human auditory regions with both sensory and motor response properties, analogous to single-unit responses in known visuomotor integration areas. The sensory phase of the task involved listening to speech (nonsense sentences) or music (novel piano melodies); the “motor” phase of the task involved covert rehearsal/humming of the auditory stimuli. A small set of areas in the superior temporal and temporal– parietal cortex responded both during the listening phase and the rehearsal/humming phase.

abstract = {The neural response to stimulus repetition is not uniform across brain regions, stimulus modalities, or task contexts. For instance, it has been observed in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that sometimes stimulus repetition leads to a relative reduction in neural activity (repetition suppression), whereas in other cases repetition results in a relative increase in activity (repetition enhancement). In the present study, we hypothesized that in the context of a verbal short-term recognition memory task, repetition-related "increases" should be observed in the same posterior temporal regions that have been previously associated with "persistent activity" in working memory rehearsal paradigms. We used fMRI and a continuous recognition memory paradigm with short lags to examine repetition effects in the posterior and anterior regions of the superior temporal cortex. Results showed that, consistent with our hypothesis, the 2 posterior temporal regions consistently associated with working memory maintenance, also show repetition increases during short-term recognition memory. In contrast, a region in the anterior superior temporal lobe showed repetition suppression effects, consistent with previous research work on perceptual adaptation in the auditory-verbal domain. We interpret these results in light of recent theories of the functional specialization along the anterior and posterior axes of the superior temporal lobe.},

This basic cognitive strategy has been elegantly codified in Baddeley and colleagues model of verbal working memory, the phonological loop. Here we explore how the intuitive appeal of the phonological loop is grounded in the phenomenological experience of subvocal rehearsal as consisting of an interaction between an "inner voice" and an "inner ear." We focus particularly on how our intuitions about the phenomenological experience of "inner speech" might constrain or otherwise inform the functional architecture of information processing models of verbal working memory such as the phonological loop; and how, indeed, how ideas about consciousness may offer alternative explanations for the dual nature of inner speech in verbal working memory.},

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate how mnemonic load and the rate of subvocal rehearsal modulate patterns of activity in the core neural circuits underlying verbal working memory. Using fMRI in healthy subjects, we orthogonally manipulated subvocal rehearsal rate and memory load in a verbal WM task with long 45-s delay periods. We found that middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) exhibited memory load effects primarily early in the delay period and did not exhibit rehearsal rate effects. In contrast, we found that inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), premotor cortex (PM) and Sylvian-parietal-temporal region (area Spt) exhibited approximately linear memory load and rehearsal rate effects, with rehearsal rate effects lasting through the entire delay period. These results indicate that IFG, PM and area Spt comprise the core articulatory rehearsal areas involved in verbal WM, while MFG and SPL are recruited in a general supervisory role once a memory load threshold in the core rehearsal network has been exceeded.},

In this report we compare DBM to semimanual tracing of brain ventricles in a population of 39 patients with schizophrenia. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained and processed with DBM and interactive tracing software. We evaluate the validity of the DBM in two different approaches. First, we divide subjects into two groups based on the mean ventricular/brain ratios and compute statistical maps of displacement vectors and their spatial derivatives. This analysis demonstrates a striking consistency of the DBM and visual tracing results. We show that restricting the information about the deformation fields by computing the local Jacobian determinant (as a measure of volume change) provides evidence of the shape of ventricular deformation which is unavailable from ventricular volume measures alone. Second, we compute a mean measure of the Jacobian values over the entire ventricles and observe a correlation of r = 0.962 with visual tracing based ventricular/brain ratios. The results support the usefulness and validity of DBM for the local and global examination of brain morphology. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

All three meta-analyses revealed distributed frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with the status of the WCST as an attention-demanding executive task. The WCST was associated with extensive bilateral clusters of reliable cross-study activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Task switching revealed a similar, although less robust, frontoparietal pattern with additional clusters of activity in the opercular region of the ventral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Response-suppression tasks, represented by studies of the go/no-go paradigm, showed a large and highly right-lateralized region of activity in the right prefrontal cortex. The activation patterns are interpreted as reflecting a neural fractionation of the cognitive components that must be integrated during the performance of the WCST.},

Participants performed an articulatory localizer as well as a speech perception task where they passively listened to a set of eight syllables while undergoing fMRI. Both univariate and multivariate analyses failed to find evidence for somatotopic coding in motor or premotor cortex during speech perception. Positive evidence for the null hypothesis was further confirmed by Bayesian analyses. Results consistently show that while the lip and tongue areas of the motor cortex are sensitive to movements of the articulators, they do not appear to preferentially respond to labial and alveolar speech sounds during passive speech perception.},

Greater BOLD activation for letters surrounded by flankers than for large letters was observed in the pulvinar as anticipated and was also marked in the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN), anterior and superior cingulate (BA24 and BA24′), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontal operculum and insula. For the MDN, maximal functional connectivity was with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; correlations with left superior temporal, parietal, posterior frontal, and occipital regions were also observed.

Sets of two- or three-word pairs were presented bimodally, followed by a cue indicating from which modality (auditory or visual) items were to be retrieved and rehearsed over a delay. Although delay-period activation in the planum temporale (PT) was insensible to the source modality and showed sustained delay-period activity, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activated more vigorously when the retrieved items had arrived to the auditory modality and showed transient delay-period activity. Functional connectivity analysis revealed two topographically distinct fronto-temporal circuits, with STG coactivating more strongly with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and PT coactivating more strongly with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The current study assessed this relationship using fMRI to measure brain activity as participants viewed and mentally replayed a set of short videos. We used multivoxel pattern analysis to train a classifier to identify individual videos based on brain activity evoked during perception and tested how accurately the classifier could distinguish among videos during mental replay. Classification accuracy correlated positively with memory vividness, indicating that the specificity of multivariate brain patterns observed during memory retrieval was related to the subjective quality of a memory. In addition, we identified a set of brain regions whose univariate activity during retrieval predicted both memory vividness and the strength of the classifier's prediction irrespective of the particular video that was retrieved. Our results establish distributed patterns of neural reactivation as a valid and objective marker of the quality of recollection.},

abstract = {Many working memory (WM) models propose that the focus of attention (or primary memory) has a capacity limit of one to four items, and therefore, that performance on WM tasks involves retrieving some items from long-term (or secondary) memory (LTM). In the present study, we present evidence suggesting that recall of even one item on a WM task can involve retrieving it from LTM. The WM task required participants to make a deep (living/nonliving) or shallow ("e"/no "e") level-of-processing (LOP) judgment on one word and to recall the word after a 10-s delay on each trial. During the delay, participants either rehearsed the word or performed an easy or a hard math task. When the to-be-remembered item could be rehearsed, recall was fast and accurate. When it was followed by a math task, recall was slower, error-prone, and benefited from a deeper LOP at encoding, especially for the hard math condition. The authors suggest that a covert-retrieval mechanism may have refreshed the item during easy math, and that the hard math condition shows that even a single item cannot be reliably held in WM during a sufficiently distracting task-therefore, recalling the item involved retrieving it from LTM. Additionally, performance on a final free recall (LTM) test was better for items recalled following math than following rehearsal, suggesting that initial recall following math involved elaborative retrieval from LTM, whereas rehearsal did not. The authors suggest that the extent to which performance on WM tasks involves retrieval from LTM depends on the amounts of disruption to both rehearsal and covert-retrieval/refreshing maintenance mechanisms.},

Indeed, because memory for the immediate past (a few seconds) and memory for the relatively more remote past (several seconds and beyond) are assumed to rely on distinct neural systems, more often than not, memory research has focused either on short- (or "working memory") or on long-term memory. Using an auditory-verbal continuous recognition paradigm designed for fMRI, we examined how the neural signatures of recognition memory change across an interval of time (from 2.5 to 30 sec) that spans this hypothetical division between short- and long-term memory. The results revealed that activity during successful auditory-verbal item recognition in inferior parietal cortex and the posterior superior temporal lobe was maximal for early lags, whereas, conversely, activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus increased as a function of lag. Taken together, the results reveal that as the interval between item repetitions increases, there is a shift in the distribution of memory-related activity that moves from posterior temporo-parietal cortex (lags 1-4) to inferior frontal regions (lags 5-10), indicating that as time advances, the burden of recognition memory is increasingly placed on top-down retrieval mechanisms that are mediated by structures in inferior frontal cortex.},

A key question regarding recency effects in the LIPC is whether they fundamentally reflect the storage (and strength) of information in memory, or whether such effects are a consequence of task difficulty or an upswing in resting state network activity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we show that recency effects in the LIPC are independent of the difficulty of recognition memory decisions, that they are not a by-product of an increase in resting state network activity, and that they appear to dissociate from regions known to be involved in verbal working memory maintenance. We conclude with a discussion of two alternative explanations - the memory strength and "expectancy" hypotheses, respectively - of the parietal lobe recency effect.},

abstract = {Objective: Physiological and pharmacological studies indicate that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) activity could contribute to a susceptibility to develop appetitive and behavioral alterations that are characteristic of bulimia nervosa (BN). Method: Eight individuals recovered from BN (REC BN) and eight healthy control women were scanned with [11C]DASB and positron emission tomography imaging of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). Logan graphical analysis was applied, and parametric binding potential (BPnondisplaceable (ND) ) images were generated. Voxel-by-voxel t-tests and a region of interest (ROI) analysis were conducted. Results: REC BN had significantly lower [11C]DASB BPND in midbrain, superior and inferior cingulate and significantly higher [11C]DASB BPND in anterior cingulate and superior temporal gyrus in the voxel-based analysis. ROI analysis indicated lower [11C]DASB BPND in midbrain (p = .07), containing the dorsal raphe, in REC BN, consistent with our earlier studies. Discussion: These preliminary findings of a small-scale study confirm and extend previous data suggesting that ill and recovered BN have altered 5-HTT measures, which potentially contribute to BN symptomatology and/or differential responses to medication.

abstract = {In a recent article entitled ‘What has functional neuroimaging told us about the mind (so far)?' Coltheart ( 2006 ) concludes that the answer to this question is: ‘nothing'. The essen- tial reason for this gloomy assessment about the value of functional neuroimaging for cognitive psychology boils down to this essential argument, namely, that since psycho- logical theories do not make predictions about the brain, it follows that such theories are necessarily consistent with all possible brain imaging results. Of course, while this state- ment is true, it is also tautological – i.e. it is true by definition. Coltheart's conclusion rests on the premise that psychological theories do not and cannot make predictions about the brain. A hypothetical philosopher of metaphysics might ask the question: ‘What has physics told us about metaphysics?' to which he might answer that because metaphysics is the science of the non-physical, physics by definition has nothing to say about meta- physics. Unlike metaphysics and physics, however, most would agree that the study of the mind and the study of the brain are fundamentally related if not, indeed, one and the same endeavour. There is therefore absolutely no reason why psychological theories should not refer to and make explicit predictions about brain function, nor is there any reason to think such theories would, upon making contact with neuroscience, somehow cease to be ‘psychological'. Indeed, the four chapters in this section all stand out as exam- ples, contra to Coltheart claims, that psychological theories can and do make predictions about the brain, and that, in the words of Postle (Chapter 8 , p. 2), ‘the distinction between strictly cognitive vs. strictly neural science is often no longer appropriate.},

abstract = {How does the brain maintain to-be-remembered informa- tion in working memory (WM), particularly when the focus of attention is drawn to processing other information? Cognitive models of WM propose that when items are displaced from fo- cal attention recall involves retrieval from long-term memory (LTM). In this fMRI study, we tried to clarify the role of LTM in performance on a WM task and the type of representation that is used to maintain an item in WM during rehearsal-filled versus distractor-filled delays. Participants made a deep or shal- low levels-of-processing (LOP) decision about a single word at encoding and tried to recall the word after a delay filled with either rehearsal of the word or a distracting math task. Recalling one word after 10 sec of distraction demonstrated behavioral and neural indices of retrieval from LTM (i.e., LOP effects and medial-temporal lobe activity). In contrast, recall after rehearsal activated cortical areas that reflected reporting the word from focal attention. In addition, areas that showed an LOP effect at encoding (e.g., left ventrolateral VLPFC and the anterior tem- poral lobes [ATLs]) were reactivated at recall, especially when recall followed distraction. Moreover, activity in left VLPFC during encoding, left ATL during the delay, and left hippocampus during retrieval predicted recall success after distraction. Whereas shallow LOP and rehearsal-related areas supported active main- tenance of one item in focal attention, the behavioral processes and neural substrates that support LTM supported recall of one item after it was displaced from focal attention.},

In an fMRI experiment, deaf participants viewed and covertly rehearsed strings of non-sense signs; analyses focused on regions responsive in both sensory and rehearsal phases. Compared with previous findings in hearing subjects, deaf subjects showed a significantly increased involvement of parietal regions. A lesion case study indicates that this network is left-dominant.

abstract = {Objective: There is increasing evidence demonstrating that circuits involving the frontal lobe, striatum, temporal lobe, and cerebellum are abnormal in individuals with schizophrenia, which suggests that metabolic activity in the white matter connecting these areas should be investigated. Method: The authors obtained [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and matching T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 170 subjects. Participants were 103 normal volunteers and 67 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (N=61) or schizoaffective disorder (N=6). The images were coregistered and warped to standard space for significance probability mapping. Results: Compared with normal volunteers, patients showed higher relative metabolic rates in the frontal white matter, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and white matter core of the temporal lobe. Elevated activity in white matter was most pronounced in the center of large white matter tracts, especially the frontal parts of the brain and the internal capsule. The white matter elevation did not appear to be entirely related to changes in gray matter/white matter brain proportions, whole brain metabolic rate bias, or excess head motion in patients, but this cannot be ruled out without absolute glucose determinations. Patients also showed significantly lower relative glucose metabolism in the frontal and temporal lobes, caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus relative to normal volunteers, which is consistent with earlier studies. Conclusions: In comparisons of unmedicated schizophrenia patients with normal volunteers, relative metabolic increases are apparent in white matter in patients with schizophrenia as well as decreases in gray matter. Inefficiency in brain circuitry, defects in white matter leading to enhanced energy need, white matter damage, and alterations in axon packing density are among the possible explanations for these schizophrenia-related findings of relatively increased metabolism in white matter.},

abstract = {Many neuroimaging studies of single-word reading have been carried out over the last 15 years, and a consensus as to the brain regions relevant to this task has emerged. Surprisingly, the planum temporale (PT) does not appear among the catalog of consistently active regions in these investigations. Recently, however, several studies have offered evidence suggesting that the left posteromedial PT plays a role in both speech production and speech perception. It is not clear, then, why so many neuroimaging studies of single-word reading-a task requiring speech production-have tended not to find evidence of PT involvement. In the present work, we employed a high-powered rapid event-related fMRI paradigm involving both single pseudoword reading and single pseudoword listening to assess activity related to reading and speech perception in the PT as a function of the degree of spatial smoothing applied to the functional images. We show that the speech area of the PT [Sylvian-parietal-temporal (Spt)] is best identified when only a moderate (5 mm) amount of spatial smoothing is applied to the data before statistical analysis. Moreover, increasing the smoothing window to 10 mm obliterates activation in the PT, suggesting that failure to find PT activation in past studies may relate to this factor. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, patients failed to show differential PPI at 120 ms and tended to show greater facilitation at 4,500 ms during novel prepulses. For control individuals, greater PPI was associated with higher relative metabolic activity rates in prefrontal (Brodmann Areas 8, 9, and 10 bilaterally) and lower in visual cortex. Patients showed this relationship only for Area 10 on the left. Patients also had low metabolism in superior, middle, and inferior prefrontal cortex.

METHOD: Twelve never medicated patients with schizophrenia (seven men, five women; mean age=29 years) and 13 normal volunteers (eight men and five women; mean age=28.5 years) underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, and coregistered anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans were also obtained. During FDG uptake, subjects performed a spatial attention task previously shown to activate the pulvinar region of the thalamus. RESULTS: Diminished regional glucose metabolism was found in the medial dorsal nucleus, posterior thalamus, and prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia relative to normal volunteers, extending earlier results from studies of medicated and previously medicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of lower relative metabolic rates in the frontothalamic circuits of patients with schizophrenia is consistent with extended circuit deficits involving interactions of frontal executive areas with thalamic sensory and association processes.},

abstract = {In perceptual decision making, the selection of an appropriate action depends critically on an organism's ability to use sensory inputs to accumulate evidence for a decision. However, differentiating decision-related processes from effects of "time on task" can be difficult. Here we combine the response signal paradigm, in which the experimenter rather than the subject dictates the time of the response, and independent components analysis (ICA) to search for signatures consistent with time on task and decision making, respectively, throughout the brain. Using this novel approach, we identify two such independent components from BOLD activity related to a random dot motion task: one sensitive to the main effect of stimulus duration, and one to both the main effect of motion coherence and its interaction with duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these two components are expressed differently throughout the brain, with activity in occipital regions most reflective of the former, activity within intraparietal sulcus modulated by both factors, and more anterior regions including the anterior insula, pre-SMA, and inferior frontal sulcus driven almost exclusively by the latter. Consistent with these ICA findings, cluster analysis identifies a posterior-to-anterior gradient that differentiates regions sensitive to time on task from regions whose activity is strongly tied to motion coherence. Together, these findings demonstrate that progressively more anterior regions are likely to participate in progressively more proximate decision-related processes.},

abstract = {We used the highly selective D2/D3 dopamine PET radioligand [F-18]fallypride to demonstrate that cognitive task induced dopamine release can be measured in the extrastriatal region of the thalamus, a region containing 10-fold fewer D2 dopamine receptors than the striatum. Human studies were acquired on 8 healthy volunteers using a single [F-18]fallypride injection PET imaging session. A spatial attention task, previously demonstrated to increase FDG uptake in the thalamus, was initiated following a period of radioligand uptake. Thalamic dopamine release was statistically tested by measuring time-dependent alterations in the kinetics (focusing on specific binding) of the [F-18]fallypride using the linearized extension of the simplified reference region model. Voxel-based analysis of the dynamic PET data sets revealed a high correlation (r = 0.86, P = 0.0067) between spatial attention task performance and thalamic dopamine release. Various aspects of the kinetic model were analyzed to address concerns such as blood flow artifacts and model bias, as well as issues with task timing and regional variations in D2/D3 receptor density. In addition to the thalamus, measurement of dopamine neuromodulation using [F-18]fallypride and a single injection PET protocol can be extended to other extrastriatal regions of the brain, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and regions of the temporal cortex. However, issues of task timing and detection sensitivity will vary depending on regional D2/D3 dopamine receptor density. Measurements of extrastriatal dopamine neuromodulation hold great promise to further our understanding of extrastriatal dopamine involvement in normal cognition and neuropsychiatric pathology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional MRI studies have begun to identify neural networks implicated in visuo-spatial working memory in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia. The study of schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) provides regional analysis in unmedicated patients in the schizophrenia spectrum. METHOD: Unmedicated patients with SPD by DSM-IV criteria and normal controls were assessed with fMRI while performing a visuo-spatial working-memory task. It required the subjects to retain the location of three dots located on the circumference of an imaginary circle and then respond to a query display in which one dot was presented and the subject required to press a button to indicate whether the probe dot location was previously displayed. Subject groups did not differ significantly in spatial memory scores. The exact Talairach and Tournoux coordinates of brain areas previously reported to show activation with spatial memory tasks were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of these locations showed BOLD response activation significantly less in patients during the memory retention period, including the left ventral prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, intraparietal cortex and posterior inferior gyrus. Regions in the right middle prefrontal and prestriate cortex showed greater activation at a trend level for patients with SPD than for normal controls. In addition, we replicated the findings of increased activation with the task in healthy volunteers in the premotor areas, ventral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: SPD patients show decreased activation compared to healthy volunteers in key frontal regions and we also provided a partial replication of findings reported in healthy subjects.},

Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.},

abstract = {Recently, neuroimaging and patient-lesion methods have been combined to explain anomalies such as patients' intact performance on tasks on which they would be predicted to perform poorly. In some cases, preserved performance has been attributed to activation of residual tissue within the damaged region. However, activation of remnant tissue can also occur in relation to impaired performance and, thus, may not necessarily correspond to successful recruitment. To constrain these neuroimaging interpretations, what is needed is a paradigm with closely matched conditions that yields intact and impaired performance in the same patient. We investigated this in H.C., an amnesic person with congenital abnormalities of the hippocampus and its connections, who was scanned during remembering and imagining, abilities known to depend on the hippocampus. Specifically, we examined whether differences in activation and/or functional connectivity would explain H.C.'s compromised ability to construct events relating to herself in autobiographical memory (SELF condition) and events relating to personally familiar others (FAMILIAR condition) versus her intact ability to construct events relating to unknown others (UNFAMILIAR condition). Despite behavioral dissociations in H.C., the pattern of activation and functional connectivity supporting her performance was strikingly similar to that of controls across conditions. Most notably, like controls, H.C. showed robust hippocampal activation and functional connectivity to the hippocampus, both when her performance was intact and impaired. Across all conditions, H.C. activated several extra-hippocampal regions to a greater extent than did controls, and modest differences were observed in functional connectivity between extra-hippocampal regions. Taken together, these findings urge caution when drawing conclusions about the functional integrity of a structurally compromised brain region even when it is activated and/or co-activated with other regions.},

Although internal representations of external stimuli have a natural tendency to decay over time or with interference, they can be kept “in mind” through the action of memory rehearsal strategies and can be subjected to various operations that manipulate information in the service of ongoing behavior. A fundamental debate about the neural basis of working memory for linguistic information is whether it is supported by a dedicated brain system in its own right or whether it emerges from the very same neural circuitry that underpins basic online language processing. Although the answer to this question remains a matter of debate, recent cognitive neuroscience research suggests that verbal working memory can be viewed as a functional adaptation of core neural substrates that enable the perception, comprehension, and production of speech.},

Relative metabolic rates were significantly higher in the right frontal lobe following fluoxetine, especially in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with higher metabolic rates in the medial frontal region and anterior cingulate when unmedicated were more likely to respond favourably to fluoxetine.

abstract = {Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a 1.6 Mb microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23 and characterized by hypersocial personality and prominent visuospatial construction impairments. Previous WS studies have identified functional and structural abnormalities in the hippocampal formation, prefrontal regions crucial for amygdala regulation and social cognition, and the dorsal visual stream, notably the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Although aberrant ventral stream activation has not been found in WS, object-related visual information that is processed in the ventral stream is a critical source of input into these abnormal regions. The present study, therefore, examined neural interactions of ventral stream areas in WS. Using a passive face- and house-viewing paradigm, activation and functional connectivity of stimulus-selective regions in fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, respectively, were investigated. During house viewing, significant activation differences were observed between participants with WS and a matched control group in IPS. Abnormal functional connectivity was found between parahippocampal gyrus and parietal cortex and between fusiform gyrus and a network of brain regions including amygdala and portions of prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that abnormal upstream visual object processing may contribute to the complex cognitive/behavioral phenotype in WS and provide a systems-level characterization of genetically mediated abnormalities of neural interactions.},

According to scanpath theory, memory-based repetition effects are mediated by repetition of the pattern of fixations or "scanpath" elicited during stimulus encoding at subsequent retrieval. However, it remains unclear how scanpath repetition supports efficiency gains on goal-directed tasks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The present study used eye-movement monitoring to test the predictions of scanpath theory against a memory-based visual search task. Younger and older subjects were instructed to find a changing target within a flickering naturalistic scene. Eye-movement search efficiency measures were compared across novel (V1) and repeated (V2) image viewings. A modified string-edit similarity measure was used to compare V1 and V2 scanpaths.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Younger adults searched more efficiently than older adults, indexed by both search time and number of fixations. An increase in search efficiency was observed for repeated images relative to novel images. This effect did not differ by age. Time-binned scanpath similarity analysis revealed repetition of initial and final V1 fixations at V2, with older adults repeating more initial V1 fixations than young adults. Consistent with previous findings, early scanpath similarity correlated negatively with search time at test. However, similarity of V2 fixations to middle V1 fixations predicted poor search performance in young adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We conclude that scanpath compression mediates increased search efficiency by selectively recapitulating encoding fixations that provide goal-relevant input. Subtle age differences in early scanpath repetition were additionally detected using these measures. Results support and extend theories of eye-movement-based repetition effects to account for efficiency gains on visual search as a function of goal-relevance and memory.

abstract = {Background: Abnormalities in the dopaminergic system are implicated in schizophrenia. [F-18]fallypride is a highly selective, high affinity PET ligand well suited for measuring D2/D3 receptor availability in the extrastriatal regions of the brain including thalamus, prefrontal, cingulate, and temporal cortex, brain regions implicated in schizophrenia with other imaging modalities. Methods: Resting [F-18]fallypride PET studies were acquired together with anatomical MRI for accurate coregistration and image analysis on 15 drug na{\"{i}}ve schizophrenics (10 men, 5 women, mean age 28.5 years) and 15 matched controls (9 men, 6 women, mean age 27.4 years). Dopamine D2/D3 receptor levels were measured as binding potential (BP). The fallypride BP images of each subject were spatially normalized and subsequently smoothed for group comparison. Measures of significance between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The medial dorsal nucleus and pulvinar were also traced on coregistered MRI for detailed assessment of BP in these regions. Results: The thalamus of patients with schizophrenia had lower [F-18]fallypride BP than normal controls and this was the brain area with the greatest difference (range - 8.5{\%} to - 27.2{\%}). Left medial dorsal nucleus and left pulvinar showed the greatest decreases (- 21.6{\%} and - 27.2{\%} respectively). The patients with schizophrenia also demonstrated D2/D3 BP reduction in the amygdala region, cingulate gyrus, and the temporal cortices. Conclusions: These findings suggest that drug na{\"{i}}ve patients with schizophrenia have significant reductions in extrastratial D2/D3 receptor availability. The reductions were most prominent in regions of the thalamus, replicating other studies both with high affinity D2/D3 ligands and consistent with FDG-PET studies, further supporting the hypothesis of thalamic abnormalities in this patient population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Research using eye movement monitoring suggests that recapitulating the pattern of eye movements made during stimulus encoding at subsequent retrieval supports memory by reinstating the spatial layout of the encoded stimulus. In the present study, the authors investigated whether recapitulation of encoding fixations during a poststudy, stimulus-free delay period—an effect that has been previously linked to memory maintenance in younger adults— can support mnemonic performance in older adults. Older adults showed greater delay-period fixation reinstatement than younger adults, and this reinstatement supported age-equivalent performance on a subsequent visuospatial-memory-based change detection task, whereas in younger adults, the performance-enhancing effects of fixation reinstatement increased with task difficulty. Taken together, these results suggest that fixation reinstatement might reflect a compensatory response to increased cognitive load. The present findings provide novel evidence of compensatory fixation reinstatement in older adults and demonstrate the utility of eye movement monitoring for aging and memory research. Public Significance Statement Eye movements can be used to boost memory. Here, we show that when asked to remember the locations of objects within a scene, older adults will spontaneously rehearse the locations by looking with their eyes at the spaces that had been previously occupied by those objects. This gaze pattern supports subsequent memory performance. This study enhances our understanding of the role eye movements play in memory and establishes eye-movement monitoring as a useful method in aging research.},

abstract = {Speech signals provide both linguistic information (e.g., words and sentences) as well as information about the speaker who produced the message (i.e., social-indexical information). Listeners store highly detailed representations of these speech signals, which are simultaneously indexed with linguistic and social category membership. A variety of methodologies—forced-choice categorization, rating, and free classification—have shed light on listeners' cognitive-perceptual representations of the social-indexical information present in the speech signal. Specifically, listeners can accurately identify some talker characteristics, including native language status, approximate age, sex, and gender. Additionally, listeners have sensitivity to other speaker characteristics—such as sexual orientation, regional dialect, native language for non-native speakers, race, and ethnicity—but listeners tend to be less accurate or more variable at categorizing or rating speakers based on these constructs. However, studies have not necessarily incorporated more recent conceptions of these constructs (e.g., separating listeners' perceptions of race vs ethnicity) or speakers who do not fit squarely into specific categories (e.g., for sex perception, intersex individuals; for gender perception, genderqueer speakers; for race perception, multiracial speakers). Additional research on how the intersections of social-indexical categories influence speech perception is also needed. As the field moves forward, scholars from a variety of disciplines should be incorporated into investigations of how listeners' extract and represent facets of personal identity from speech. Further, the impact of these representations on our interactions with one another in contexts outside of the laboratory should continue to be explored.

Our aim in this study was to compare18F-fallypride binding potential BPNDin a group of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum illness vs. controls, with a particular focus on the cortex and thalamus. Methods: We acquired18F-fallypride positron emission tomography images on 33 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (28 with schizophrenia; 5 with schizoaffective disorder) and 18 normal controls. Twenty-four patients were absolutely neuroleptic na{\"{i}}ve and nine were previously medicated, although only four had a lifetime neuroleptic exposure of greater than two weeks. Parametric images of18F-fallypride BPNDwere calculated to compare binding across subjects. Results: Decreased BPNDwas observed in the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal lobe and primary auditory cortex. These findings were most marked in subjects who had never previously received medication. Conclusions: The regions with decreased BPNDtend to match brain regions previously reported to show alterations in metabolic activity and blood flow and areas associated with the symptoms of schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Converging evidence indicates that the prefrontal cortex is critically involved in executive control and that executive dysfunction is implicated in schizophrenia. Reduced dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding potential has been reported in schizophrenia, and the correlations with neuropsychological test scores have been positive and negative for different tasks. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between dopamine D2/D3 receptor levels with frontal and temporal neurocognitive performance in schizophrenia. Resting-state 18F-fallypride positron emission tomography was performed on 20 medication-na{\"{i}}ve and 5 previously medicated for brief earlier periods patients with schizophrenia and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Striatal and extra-striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor levels were quantified as binding potential using fallypride imaging. Magnetic resonance images in standard Talairach position and segmented into gray and white matter were co-registered to the fallypride images, and the AFNI stereotaxic atlas was applied. Two neuropsychological tasks known to activate frontal and temporal lobe function were chosen, specifically the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Images of the correlation coefficient between fallypride binding and WCST and CVLT performance showed a negative correlation in contrast to positive correlations in healthy volunteers. The results of this study demonstrate that lower fallypride binding potential in patients with schizophrenia may be associated with better performance. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that failed to find cognitive improvements with typical dopamine-blocking medications.},

abstract = {The Virtual Fields Method (VFM) is used to explore strain-rate dependent mechanical properties of a hyperelastic material. In this method, the principle of virtual work is constructed to inversely obtain the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a given material from optical measurements of displacement obtained during a dynamic loading event. The virtual displacement field is designed so that acceleration fields, and thereby inertial forces, are used to calculate the material properties, and the traction force term in the principle of virtual work can be eliminated. Experimentally, this means that no force measurements are required during dynamic loading. Prior to the experimental investigations, a simple analytical calculation and finite element model were used in order to simulate the method; the output from the VFM showed good agreement with the given material coefficients. For the experimental work, pure silicone rubber was chosen as a model material. This rubber was tested in tension using a drop-weight apparatus at a medium strain rate (c.a. 160 s-1), using high speed photography and Digital Image Correlation to provide strain and acceleration data which were subsequently analyzed by use of the VFM. By using static pre-stretching prior to the dynamic load, the hyperelastic behavior can be investigated up to large strains, even though the dynamic loading itself only has a small strain amplitude. By optimizing the differential one-term Ogden model to modulus estimations at each of the pre-stretching locations, the nonlinear stress-strain curves were reconstructed. The initial modulus change between these dynamic experiments and quasi-static tests was compared to the storage modulus increment obtained from DMA tests on the same material.},

abstract = {The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I, which adds $\alpha$2-6-linked sialic acids to substrate glycoproteins, has been implicated in carcinogenesis; however, the nature of its pathogenic role remains poorly understood. Here we show that ST6Gal-I is upregulated in ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas, enriched in metastatic tumors, and associated with reduced patient survival. Notably, ST6Gal-I upregulation in cancer cells conferred hallmark cancer stem-like cell (CSC) characteristics. Modulating ST6Gal-I expression in pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells directly altered CSC spheroid growth, and clonal variants with high ST6Gal-I activity preferentially survived in CSC culture. Primary ovarian cancer cells from patient ascites or solid tumors sorted for $\alpha$2-6 sialylation grew as spheroids, while cells lacking $\alpha$2-6 sialylation remained as single cells and lost viability. ST6Gal-I also promoted resistance to gemcitabine and enabled the formation of stably resistant colonies. Gemcitabine treatment of patient-derived xenograft tumors enriched for ST6Gal-I-expressing cells relative to pair-matched untreated tumors. ST6Gal-I also augmented tumor-initiating potential. In limiting dilution assays, subcutaneous tumor formation was inhibited by ST6Gal-I knockdown, whereas in a chemically induced tumor initiation model, mice with conditional ST6Gal-I overexpression exhibited enhanced tumorigenesis. Finally, we found that ST6Gal-I induced expression of the key tumor-promoting transcription factors, Sox9 and Slug. Collectively, this work highlighted a previously unrecognized role for a specific glycosyltransferase in driving a CSC state. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3978-88. {\textcopyright}2016 AACR.},

abstract = {When we have a rich and vivid memory for a past experience, it often feels like we are transported back in time to witness once again this event. Indeed, a perfect memory would exactly mimic the experiential quality of direct sensory perception. We used fMRI and multivoxel pattern analysis to map and quantify the similarity between patterns of activation evoked by direct perception of a diverse set of short video clips and the vivid remembering, with closed eyes, of these clips. We found that the patterns of distributed brain activation during vivid memory mimicked the patterns evoked during sensory perception. Using whole-brain patterns of activation evoked by perception of the videos, we were able to accurately classify brain patterns that were elicited when participants tried to vividly recall those same videos. A discriminant analysis of the activation patterns associated with each video revealed a high degree (explaining over 80{\%} of the variance) of shared representational similarity between perception and memory. These results show that complex, multifeatured memory involves a partial reinstatement of the whole pattern of brain activity that is evoked during initial perception of the stimulus.},
